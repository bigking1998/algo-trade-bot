## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION MISSION: Transform Dashboard to Production Trading Platform

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: This repository is undergoing a systematic transformation from a market data dashboard into a production-ready algorithmic trading platform over 32 weeks. We are following a comprehensive implementation plan with strict task-based development, agent specialization, and continuous validation.

### üìã MANDATORY TASK-BASED DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: ONLY work on tasks from `COMPLETE_TASK_LIST.md` - NO exceptions!**

All development must follow the structured 128-task system with these requirements:

- **Task Selection**: Only work on tasks marked as "ready" (all dependencies completed)
- **Unique Task ID**: Each task has a specific ID (DB-001, BE-001, FE-001, etc.)
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every task defines exactly what "done" means
- **Agent Specialization**: Work only on tasks matching your agent type
- **Dependency Respect**: Never start a task until prerequisites are 100% complete
- **Validation Mandatory**: Every task must pass all validation steps before proceeding

### üìä COMPLETE TASK SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Total Implementation Scope**: 128 tasks across 32 weeks (1,856 hours)

   ```
5. **ZERO REGRESSION POLICY**: System must remain fully functional after every change
6. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: Every deliverable in task specification must be completed
7. **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES**: Update all relevant documentation for changes made

### üö® TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Before Starting ANY Task:**
1. ‚úÖ **Verify Task ID**: Confirm task exists in `COMPLETE_TASK_LIST.md`
2. ‚úÖ **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all prerequisite tasks are 100% complete
3. ‚úÖ **Agent Match**: Confirm your agent type matches task assignment
4. ‚úÖ **Review Acceptance Criteria**: Understand exactly what constitutes completion
5. ‚úÖ **Validate Current System**: Ensure system works before making changes

**After Completing ANY Task:**
1. ‚úÖ **Run Full Validation Suite**: All validation commands must pass
2. ‚úÖ **Verify Acceptance Criteria**: Every requirement must be met
3. ‚úÖ **Test System Integration**: Entire system must remain functional
4. ‚úÖ **Update Progress Tracking**: Mark task as complete in tracking system
5. ‚úÖ **Document Any Issues**: Record problems and solutions for future reference

### üìã TASK SELECTION PROCESS

**Step 1: Identify Ready Tasks**
- Review `COMPLETE_TASK_LIST.md` for tasks with completed dependencies
- Current ready tasks: DB-001 (no dependencies), then DB-002, BE-001, etc.

**Step 2: Agent Assignment Verification** 
- üóÑÔ∏è DatabaseAgent: Tasks DB-001 through DB-006
- ‚öôÔ∏è BackendAgent: Tasks BE-001 through BE-065  
- üé® FrontendAgent: Tasks FE-001 through FE-024
- üß† MLAgent: Tasks ML-001 through ML-013
- üöÄ DevOpsAgent: Tasks DO-001 through DO-009

**Step 3: Task Execution Request Format**
```
"I need you to act as [AgentType] and execute Task [ID]: [Title].

Please review the complete task specification in COMPLETE_TASK_LIST.md 
and implement all acceptance criteria including:
- [List specific deliverables]
- [Performance targets]
- [Testing requirements]

After completion, run the mandatory validation sequence."
```

### üìö MANDATORY REFERENCE DOCUMENTS

**PRIMARY TASK REFERENCE** (Must consult for every task):
- üìã `COMPLETE_TASK_LIST.md` - **ALL 128 TASKS** with specifications and acceptance criteria

**SUPPORTING ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTS**:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_2025.md` - 32-week strategic development plan  
- `CAPABILITY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Current state vs target capabilities

- `npm run lint` - ESLint with TypeScript extensions, max warnings 0
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

### Testing
- `npm test` - Run tests using Vitest
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with Vitest UI interface

## Architecture Overview

This is an algorithmic trading bot with a React frontend and Node.js backend, designed to integrate with dYdX v4 for live market data and trading.

### Project Structure
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Shadcn UI components
  - `src/frontend/` - Main React application with dashboard views
  - `src/frontend/components/ui/` - Shadcn UI primitive components  
  - `src/frontend/hooks/` - React Query hooks for data fetching and WebSocket streams
  - `src/frontend/lib/api/` - API client wrappers
- **Backend**: Node.js HTTP server with dYdX integration
  - `src/backend/server.ts` - Main HTTP server with CORS and JSON handling
  - `src/backend/routes/` - API route handlers for dYdX data, orders, backtesting
  - `src/backend/dydx/` - dYdX Indexer client and WebSocket gateway
- **Shared**: Common types and utilities
  - `src/shared/types/trading.ts` - Comprehensive trading domain models and dYdX v4 types

### Key Technologies
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Data Flow**: React Query for REST API calls, RxJS for WebSocket streams
- **Charting**: Lightweight Charts library loaded via CDN for candlestick visualization
- **Backend**: Plain Node.js HTTP server (no framework) proxying dYdX Indexer REST/WS
- **Testing**: Vitest with jsdom and Testing Library

### Backend API Structure
The backend serves as a proxy to dYdX v4 Indexer with these main endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Service health check
- `/api/dydx/markets` - Live market information
- `/api/dydx/candles` - Historical and live candlestick data
- `/api/dydx/oracle` - Oracle price feeds
- Future endpoints for wallet integration, order placement, and backtesting

### Frontend Data Architecture
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Real-time Data**: RxJS observables for WebSocket streams
- **Chart Integration**: Direct lightweight-charts integration with dYdX candle data
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types shared between frontend and backend

### Key Features Implemented
- Real-time market data from dYdX v4 Indexer
- Interactive candlestick charts with symbol/timeframe selection
- Markets table with live oracle prices and trading parameters
- Candle history table with filtering capabilities
- Strategy builder UI framework (backend strategy execution pending)
- Trading bot status monitoring with API connectivity indicators

### Development Notes
- Uses Vite proxy to route `/api/*` requests to backend at localhost:3001
- Backend uses plain HTTP server with manual CORS handling
- All data fetching goes through React Query hooks for caching and error handling
- Shadcn components should be added via CLI when new UI primitives are needed
- TypeScript strict mode enabled with path aliases configured

# DB-002: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB Schema Implementation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for Task DB-002: Database Schema Implementation for the algorithmic trading platform. The schema is designed for enterprise-grade high-frequency trading with TimescaleDB optimization.

## Schema Architecture

### Core Tables

1. **strategies** - Strategy configuration and management
2. **market_data** - Time-series market data (HYPERTABLE)
3. **trades** - Trade execution history (HYPERTABLE)
4. **orders** - Order management (HYPERTABLE)
5. **portfolio_snapshots** - Portfolio state history (HYPERTABLE)
6. **system_logs** - Application logging (HYPERTABLE)

### Key Features

- ✅ TimescaleDB hypertables for optimal time-series performance
- ✅ Compression policies reducing storage by up to 90%
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- ✅ Optimized indexes for high-frequency trading queries
- ✅ Data validation and integrity checks
- ✅ Retention policies for regulatory compliance
- ✅ Materialized views for performance
- ✅ Functions and triggers for automation

## Performance Optimizations

### TimescaleDB Hypertables

All time-series tables are converted to TimescaleDB hypertables with:
- **market_data**: 1-day chunks, compressed after 7 days
- **trades**: 1-day chunks, compressed after 30 days
- **orders**: 1-day chunks for order lifecycle tracking
- **portfolio_snapshots**: 1-day chunks, compressed after 90 days
- **system_logs**: 1-hour chunks, compressed after 3 days

### Compression Ratios

Expected storage savings:
- Market data: 85-90% compression
- Trade data: 70-80% compression
- Portfolio snapshots: 80-85% compression
- System logs: 75-80% compression

### Index Strategy

**High-Performance Indexes:**
- Time-based indexes for chronological queries
- Composite indexes for multi-column filters
- Partial indexes for selective data
- GIN indexes for JSONB search operations

## Query Performance Targets

Based on research and best practices for trading platforms:

- **Market data retrieval**: < 5ms for recent data
- **Trade history queries**: < 10ms for filtered results
- **Strategy performance**: < 20ms for comprehensive metrics
- **Portfolio analysis**: < 15ms for real-time calculations

## Data Retention Policies

Compliance with financial regulations:

- **Market data**: 2 years (1m timeframe), 5 years (higher timeframes)
- **Trades**: 7 years (regulatory compliance)
- **Orders**: 7 years (regulatory compliance)
- **Portfolio snapshots**: 5 years
- **System logs**: 1 year

## Schema Validation

### Core Requirements Met ✅

1. **All 6 core tables implemented** with proper structure
2. **TimescaleDB hypertables** for time-series optimization
3. **High-frequency trading support** with microsecond precision
4. **Foreign key relationships** maintaining data integrity
5. **Query optimization** for common trading patterns

### Advanced Features ✅

- **Materialized views** for performance
- **Custom functions** for calculations
- **Automatic triggers** for data consistency
- **Compression policies** for storage optimization
- **Retention policies** for compliance

## Sample Performance Queries

### 1. Real-time Strategy Performance
```sql
SELECT * FROM strategy_performance_summary 
WHERE status = 'active' 
ORDER BY total_pnl DESC;
```

### 2. High-Frequency Market Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    symbol,
    DATE_TRUNC('minute', time) as minute,
    AVG(close) as avg_price,
    SUM(volume) as total_volume,
    MAX(high) - MIN(low) as price_range
FROM market_data 
WHERE timeframe = '1m' 
  AND time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY symbol, DATE_TRUNC('minute', time)
ORDER BY symbol, minute;
```

### 3. Portfolio Performance Analysis
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', time) as hour,
       AVG(total_value) as avg_portfolio_value,
       AVG(unrealized_pnl) as avg_unrealized_pnl
FROM portfolio_snapshots 
WHERE time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('hour', time)
ORDER BY hour;
```

## Implementation Commands

### 1. Install Extensions
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

### 2. Execute Schema
```bash
psql -U postgres -d trading_platform -f database/schema_enterprise.sql
```

### 3. Validate Installation
```sql
-- Check hypertables
SELECT hypertable_name, num_chunks 
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;

-- Verify compression
SELECT hypertable_name, compression_enabled 
FROM timescaledb_information.hypertables;

-- Check retention policies
SELECT hypertable_name, job_id, schedule_interval 
FROM timescaledb_information.jobs 
WHERE job_type = 'retention';
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor chunk sizes
SELECT 
    chunk_schema,
    chunk_name,
    table_name,
    chunk_size,
    is_compressed
FROM timescaledb_information.chunks 
ORDER BY chunk_size DESC;

-- Index usage statistics
SELECT 
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('market_data', 'trades', 'orders')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### Compression Monitoring
```sql
SELECT 
    hypertable_name,
    SUM(uncompressed_bytes) as uncompressed,
    SUM(compressed_bytes) as compressed,
    ROUND(SUM(compressed_bytes)::NUMERIC / SUM(uncompressed_bytes) * 100, 2) as compression_ratio
FROM timescaledb_information.compressed_chunk_stats
GROUP BY hypertable_name;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Row-level security** can be implemented for multi-tenant strategies
2. **Column encryption** for sensitive trading parameters
3. **Audit logging** for all data modifications
4. **Connection pooling** with SSL/TLS encryption
5. **Regular backup verification** with point-in-time recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chunk exclusion not working**: Check time column data types
2. **Compression failing**: Verify segment_by columns exist
3. **Foreign key violations**: Ensure referential integrity
4. **Performance degradation**: Monitor index usage statistics

### Performance Tuning

1. **Analyze query plans** with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. **Monitor compression ratios** and adjust policies
3. **Update table statistics** regularly
4. **Consider partitioning** for extremely high-volume data

## Next Steps

After successful schema implementation (DB-002):

1. **DB-003**: Database Migration System
2. **BE-001**: Database Connection Manager
3. **BE-002**: Base Repository Implementation
4. **TE-001**: Database Integration Tests

## Compliance Notes

This schema design meets requirements for:
- **MiFID II** transaction reporting
- **SEC** trade surveillance
- **CFTC** derivatives reporting
- **SOX** financial controls

The 7-year retention policy ensures compliance with most financial regulations worldwide.
